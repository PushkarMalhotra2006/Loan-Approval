\## 📌 Problem Statement



Banks need to evaluate loan applications efficiently. This project predicts loan approval status using applicant information like income, credit history, and loan details.



\---



\## 📊 Dataset



The dataset contains loan application records with features such as:



\* Gender

\* Married

\* Dependents

\* Education

\* Self\_Employed

\* ApplicantIncome

\* CoapplicantIncome

\* LoanAmount \*(in thousands)\*

\* Loan\_Amount\_Term \*(in months)\*

\* Credit\_History

\* Property\_Area

\* Loan\_Status \*(Target)\*



Dataset file:



Dataset/loan-train.csv





\---



\## ⚙️ Preprocessing \& Feature Engineering



\* Handled missing values using mode/median imputation

\* Converted categorical variables to numerical

\* One-hot encoded Property\_Area

\* Created new feature: \*\*Total\_Income\*\*

\* Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler



\---



\## 🤖 Model



\* Logistic Regression



\### 📈 Performance



\* Accuracy: \~0.78

\* F1 Score: \~0.85



\---



\## 🧠 Key Insights



\* Strong dependency on \*\*Credit\_History\*\*

\* Dataset is relatively small (\~600 rows)

\* Model may reject unusual combinations due to data bias



\---



\## 🌐 Application Features

\* 🔹 Batch Prediction via CSV upload

\* 🔹 Download predictions as CSV

\* 🔹 Built using Streamlit



\---



\## 🛠️ Tech Stack
